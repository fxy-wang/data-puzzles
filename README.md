# data-puzzles

## what this is 

In my quest to prepare myself for data science / AI interviews when I eventually finish my Ph.D.,
I stumbled upon https://data-puzzles.com. I thought solving these would be a great way to practice
my skills while also itching the part of my brain that loves a good problem solving scenario.

Once you complete the puzzles on https://data-puzzles.com they post their own solution. The 
notebooks that I upload here are my own solutions to the puzzles. 

Enjoy :)
